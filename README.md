Morse code is a method of encoding text information as a series of on-off tones, clicks, or light flashes that can be used for communication over a telegraph or other communication device. Each letter, number, and punctuation mark has its own unique sequence of dots and dashes

- *Dots (â€¢)*: Short signals
- *Dashes (-)*: Long signals
- *Each letter and number*: Has a unique sequence of dots and dashes

Morse code was widely used in the past for communication, especially in maritime and military contexts.

Morse code was created in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and his colleagues for use with the telegraph, a device that sent messages over wires.

Morse code solved this problem by assigning unique sequences of dots and dashes to each letter, number, and punctuation mark. This allowed messages to be transmitted efficiently and accurately over the telegraph.

Morse code was used for secure communication during wars
Morse code played a crucial role in revolutionizing long-distance communication.
